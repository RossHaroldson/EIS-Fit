function fits = AdvancedFitZ(Z, freq, ImpFunc, v0, lb, ub, options)
%UNTITLED Summary of this function goes here
%   This function will be used to call fitZ multiple times with feedback
%   between algorithms and parameter sweeps. This is only focused on
%   getting the best fit using one impedance function.
